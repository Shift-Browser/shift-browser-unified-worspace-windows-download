## 🧠 Overview

**Shift Browser** is a desktop-based browsing solution built to streamline digital workflows by consolidating multiple web applications and accounts into a single, organized interface. Instead of switching between browser profiles or constantly logging in and out of services, users can manage everything from one structured environment.

Designed for productivity-driven professionals, Shift allows seamless handling of multiple email accounts, collaboration platforms, CRM systems, and project tools simultaneously. Each account operates independently while remaining easily accessible from a centralized sidebar.

Tailored for Windows systems, the application delivers stable performance, structured navigation, and enhanced focus for users who rely heavily on cloud services. Its workspace-based layout helps reduce distractions while improving efficiency across daily tasks.
